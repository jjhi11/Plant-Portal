<h1><strong>Wetland Classification</strong></h1>
<p>Wetland classes are presented by <a href="https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions">ecoregion</a>, areas where ecosystems are generally similar based on patterns in geology, landforms, soils, vegetation, climate, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. Ecoregions are hierarchically arranged at four levels with 2 level I ecoregions, 3 level II ecoregions, 7 level III ecoregions, and 36 level IV ecoregions in Utah. Three level III ecoregions make up more than 95% of Utah, including the Central Basin and Range, the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains, and the Colorado Plateau. The majority of wetland survey data contributed to this application to date have been from the first two level III ecoregions, so wetland classes for now focus on those two ecoregions only. Within each ecoregion, wetland sites were further classified based on factors such as dominant overstory life form (herbaceous, shrub, tree), water regime, and landscape position.</p>
<h2><strong>Central Basin and Range</strong></h2>
<p>We used data from 204 sites surveyed in the Central Basin and Range by the UGS between 2013 and 2018 to develop seven initial wetland classes that take into account dominant overstory life form, water regime, salinity tolerance, and landscape position. More information about the development of the Central Basin and Range classes can be found in the (link to Bear River report when complete). We anticipate that these wetland classes will be modified in 2020 at the conclusion of a two-year study of wetlands in the Central Basin and Range of Utah.</p>

<h2><strong>Wasatch and Uinta Mountains (including Wyoming Basin)</strong></h2>
<p>We classified wetlands sites in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains into ten classes based on dominant overstory life form, water regime, and location within level IV ecoregion. We included the only site we had from the Wyoming Basin in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains ecoregion because it had similar species composition to other sites in the ecoregion. In some cases, a site that falls in one level IV ecoregion may be more similar floristically to sites in a different level IV ecoregion, as was found by UGS&rsquo; analysis of wetland data in the <a href="https://geodata.geology.utah.gov/pages/view.php?ref=23769">Weber watershed</a>. These sites will be reclassified to the wetland class that best matches their vegetation communities whenever possible.</p>

<h1><strong>Vegetation Condition</strong></h1>
<p>We assigned sites to vegetation condition classes based solely on plant community composition data. &ldquo;Reference&rdquo; sites are sites with the most intact plant communities for a particular wetland class, regardless of the degree of landscape disturbance adjacent to these sites or whether other stressors are present. We used two metrics, relative native cover and mean C, to classify sites. Relative native cover is the percent of all plant cover that is composed of native species. Mean C is a metric that relies on coefficient of conservatism values (C-values). C-values between 1 and 10 are assigned to species based on their association with disturbance through a combination of best professional judgment, literature review, and/or field observations. Low values indicate that species are usually found at disturbed sites, high values indicate that species are associated with pristine sites, and values in the middle indicate that species may be found equally at either type of site. All non-native species are assigned a C-value of 0. Mean C is calculated by taking the average C-value for all species at a site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reference&rdquo; sites are those sites with a mean C value within the top 25% of sites for the wetland class and with &ge;80% relative native cover. Sites where &lt;75% of the species were assigned C-values were classified as &ldquo;not enough data&rdquo; as well as sites having high mean C values but &lt;75% of the species by cover with known nativity. We did not classify any sites as reference for wetland classes having &lt;10 sites; these sites were all classified as &ldquo;not enough data.&rdquo;</p>
